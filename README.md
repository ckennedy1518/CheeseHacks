# CheeseHacks
Hackathon presented on UW-Madison campus<br />
<br />
Content developers: Christopher Kennedy, Mitch Brenner, Ben Wurster, and Prannav Arora<br />
Challenge: Create a Website in 24 hours<br />
Category: "Return to the Classroom"<br />
Idea: Create a chat website for collaboration during lectures and homework. This would be beneficial for large lectures that don't offer a lot of support (Calc III for example) where students can post quick questions during lecture for conceptual understanding. It would also help students collaborate virtually for homework with the ability to live message.<br />
Building out the project: Initially, the user will interact with the website by entering a code/class ID (this can be anything from "CS577 Lecture" to "Math475 HW") as well as a username they'll appear as. If they're creating this space/no one has entered this code, they will be sent to this newly created area. If they are joining a created class, they will be entered into the space with other users. Once the user is inside the space, we want them to be able to send a chat message that will refresh live on all users' screens. This is the core feature of the website. Additionally, users will be able to react to messages with emojis and send files.
