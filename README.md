# CheeseHacks
Hackathon presented on UW-Madison campus<br />
<br />
Content developers: Christopher Kennedy, Mitch Brenner, Ben Wurster, and Prannav Arora<br />
Challenge: Create a website in 24 hours<br />
Category: "Return to the Classroom"<br />
Idea: Create a chat website for collaboration during lectures and homework. This would be beneficial for large lectures that don't offer a lot of support (Calc III for example) where students can post quick questions during lecture for conceptual understanding. It would also help students collaborate virtually for homework with the ability to live message.<br />
Building out the project: Initiially, the user will interact with the website by choosing whether or not they want to create a virtual space or join one. The next step the user will take is entering a code/class ID (this can be anything from "CS577 Lecture" to "Math475 HW"). If they're creating this space, they will be sent to this newly created area. If they are joining, we will check the code/class ID entered to see if it exists. If it does, they will be entered into the space. If not, an error message will show up saying that the class they're trying to enter has not been created. Once the user is inside the space, we want them to be able to send a chat message that will refresh live on all users' screens. This is the core feature of the website. Additionally, users will be able to react to messages with emojis and send files.
